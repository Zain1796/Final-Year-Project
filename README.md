INTRODUCTION:

The internet has become a popular platform for people to share their opinions, comments, and feelings. As of 2022, there are 4.6 billion social media users worldwide. A large number of users create textual posts on online platforms every day. Currently, about 56.8% of the global population uses social media. When considering eligible audiences, 93.33% of 4.8 billion internet users and 85% of 5.27 billion mobile phone users are on social media.

People often use social media to interact with others and express their feelings. For example, jobless individuals may post on LinkedIn about their depression due to unemployment. Previous research has shown that changes in mood and negative sentiments can be tracked through social media.

A study by Jitimon Angskun, Suda Tipprasert, and Thara Angskun focused on detecting depression using social networks. They explored five machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and Deep Learning. The results indicated that the Random Forest technique had the highest accuracy in detecting depression. This research introduced a new model that analyzes the demographic characteristics and text sentiment of Twitter users to identify depressive moods. It is a step towards reducing suicide rates associated with depression.




PROBLEM STATMENT:

Detecting and understanding mental health issues, such as depression, is a critical task in today's digital era. With the widespread use of social media platforms like Twitter, there is an opportunity to analyze user-generated content, specifically tweets, to identify signs of depression. This project aims to develop a Python-based system that leverages sentiment analysis techniques to detect depression through the analysis of tweets.
